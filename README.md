Seal is (will be) a Typescript/Html Canvas tool/art project inspired by  https://twitter.com/ebooks_goetia. The project aim is to 1. make cool looking stuff 2. learn Typescript.

Seal will use a context free grammar to generate a JSON object representing a randomly generated sigil. Seal will also accept a JSON object describing a sigil and generate it.

Stretch goals include generating brush styles, so that sigils of different styles can be generated (painted, printed, woodcut, etc), and bot functionality.
